> ### React Native codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Typescript & React Native & Remx** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **React Native** community styleguides & best practices.
